# ML From Scratch

This repository contains a Machine Learning library built **from scratch** using only **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** — without using scikit-learn or any high-level ML frameworks.

## Features

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- Linear Regression (Gradient Descent & Normal Equation)
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means Clustering
- Decision Tree (CART)

## Neural Network (From Scratch)
- Fully connected N-layer architecture
- Forward & Backward propagation
- Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax
- Weight initialization: He, Xavier
- Optimizers: SGD, Momentum, RMSProp, Adam

## Utilities
- Feature scaling & normalization
- Train-test split
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1, RMSE, R²)
- Visualization utilities (loss curves)

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
